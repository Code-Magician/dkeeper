1. Create a new dfx project.

2. Delete the index.html, main.css and the index.js 
   which is for the frontend.

3. Create the react app somewhere and then move the 
   index.html,index.js ( Rename it to index.jsx ) and components if there are 
   any to the src below the assets folder. and move 
   the style.css file in assets folder.

4. Now goto file webpack.config.js and where it is commented as 
   "frontend.entrypoint" change the ".js" extention to ".jsx"
   In the same file there will be a section which will be commented 
   you have to uncomment it. To find the section search for keyword 
   "React" or "using react".

5. Make a tsconfig.json file and write the content below and save it.
   {
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es2018",        /* Specify ECMAScript target version: 'ES3' (default), 'ES5', 'ES2015', 'ES2016', 'ES2017', 'ES2018', 'ES2019' or 'ESNEXT'. */
        "lib": ["ES2018", "DOM"],  /* Specify library files to be included in the compilation. */
        "allowJs": true,           /* Allow javascript files to be compiled. */
        "jsx": "react",            /* Specify JSX code generation: 'preserve', 'react-native', or 'react'. */
    },
    "include": ["src/**/*"],
  }

6. Change the content of package.json file. See the package.json file to see what to change.

7. Now We can run the project as normal and the project will use React as a frontend.
